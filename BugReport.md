# Bug Report

## Summary
The search result for countries does not display the correct country information when a substring of the country name is entered.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to Airalo homepage https://www.airalo.com/
2. In the search field type : Mal
3. Wait for the search result to show up

## Expected Results
User expects country Malta to show up in the search result

## Actual Results
Guatemala shows up in the search result

## Reproducibility
Always

## Environment
Production

## Additional Information
The search result shows the correct country information when i type the complete country name.
However, I think that if there are multiple matches for the string that user types, then all the matching options should be shown for better user experience.
